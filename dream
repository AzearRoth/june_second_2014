So last night I had what felt like a few dreams.  I remember playing guitar on a train with a total stranger.  I can't remember the instrument he was playing.
However I was playing playing a guitar.  He was also talking to me about how he was friends with this famous person, who I didn't know by name.  Someone else on 
the train, around his age, knew who he was too (the famous person).  They talked about it for a while.  The man I was playing with was australian and had red hair.

When I got off the train I went to my parents house to audition to be their new child.  Someone like me and my sister were already their kids and I was to be their third.
It was a bit surreal seeing my traits and my sisters laid out, and trying to make a convincing argument for a position I already knew I filled quite well.
This was probably a reference to my feelings regarding the job market.  I know I'm a good fit, a part of the family, so why are you still making me interview?
It's dumb.  But whatever.  

There was some other stuff here, but I can't remember what it was.  However, I remember being lonely for some reason.  There were a few other feelings too.
