The economic costs of net neutrality are great.  If I was going to respond to them, financially, I would move my positions out of growing technology firms.
First, anyone fighting against the FCC ruling would be very high on my list of companies to take a smaller position in.  Second, I would move over to hard
engineering stocks that are doing innovative things, which should cover some of the difference.  The barriers to entry into hardware have gotten smaller.
Also software companies that have a primarily B2B function are still safe.  However, facebook, google and a few others would no longer be the titans they are now.
Basically, consumer facing is dead.  Sure the tech market will respond and there will be some backlash to B2B too because they mostly work with B2C businesses.
Essentially, anyone working on anything is going to fail.  We will see silicon valley leave and NYC will go back to being a financial giant.  The tech companies that
just moved in will close their doors.  Silicon valley will certainly be hit the hardest.  Stanfords acceptance rate will go up.  The engineering colleges will become
more important again, computer science schools will crumble.  

But only somewhat.  There will be a shift.  And then things will adapt.  New jobs will come around.  Still comcast and twc are bastards.  Maybe there will be
a reaction from people where companies make their own internet.  There may be a disinfrachising effect.  I would start trying to compete with telecomms.
